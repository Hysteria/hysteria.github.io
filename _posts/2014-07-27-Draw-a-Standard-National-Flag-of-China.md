I had written the codes to draw five-pointed star serveral days ago. So, when I came to so boring today, an idea come up, maybe I could draw a China flag using those codes.
After hours work(pardon me if you thought I am inefficient). I had drawn the flag of Great China, I admit that I was so excited that moment.
