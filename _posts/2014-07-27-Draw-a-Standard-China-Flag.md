I had written the codes to draw five-pointed star serveral days ago. So, when I came to so boring today, an idea come up, maybe I could draw a China flag using those codes.
After hours working(pardon me if you thought I am slow). I had drawn the fucking Great China flag, I admit that I was so excited that moment.
